# TimeIn 

A simple timezone current time application. Written in Compose Multiplatform. From the tutorial [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-new-project.html#improve-the-style).

This is the most basic implementation and leaves a lot more which can be done. For example dependency injection with Coin or API requests with Ktor.
